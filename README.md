# TWITTER SCRAPING
This is a project for scraping data from twitter. Here the program is to scrape data from twitter based on the keyword input provided by the user. The interface must be able to take inputs like No.of tweets and The 
to and from Dates of the tweets. Based on the input information the data collected should be converted into a format that it could be stored in a No SQL data base. Here we are using MongoDB for this purpose. The data
scraped from the twitter is stored in JSON format in MongoDB. Tools used are: Python, Streamlit and MongoDB.
